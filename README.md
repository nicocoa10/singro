Music Producers often dont have access to amazing vocals, or it can be extremely hard to find that voice it perfectly suits your track . This web app main goal is to solve that problem . Its goal is to bring music producers and songwriters in a single online space to share information , music , and mainly collaborate together .

The websites initial functionalities will be to :
  - Make posts , comments , sharing such as blog functionality to connect both music producers and singers together .
  - Allow an user , such as a Music producer to share a track in which vocals are needed 
  - Allow an user , such as a singer/songwriter to find tracks to collaborate on .
  
Current technologies used :
