Music Producers often dont have access to amazing vocals, or it can be extremely hard to find that voice it perfectly suits your track . This web app main goal is to solve that problem . Its goal is to bring music producers and songwriters in a single online space to share information , music , and mainly collaborate together .

Important Note : Although the application is considered to be a simpler version of a social media website , I decided to take an approach to the application based on some stages of the software development cycle . This allowed me to get familiar with the SDLC and take a good idea and develop it into a good , well thought piece of software .

I focused mainly on the following stages for the application : 
       1. Planning and coming with a min set of requirements 
       2. Focusing an UI and UX design and a prototype with Figma 
       3. Software development , implementing the prototype ^  using Django as my main web framework , and HTML .CSS , Javascript for front end implementation.
       4. Testing , and deployment.
  
## Planning and Initial Set of Requirements 
The websites initial functionalities will be to :
  - Create an account for any user , using django built int User authorization model and flow .
  - Make posts , comments , sharing such as blog functionality  .
  - Create songs/groups where user can add posts and also be part of .
  - Allow an user , such as a Music producer to join a song/group to interact with the creator
  
Current technologies used :

          Back end : 
                - Django , a Python web framework 
                    - concepts used such as : templates, class based views , function views , url settings , user authentication , etc.
          Front end :
                 -HTML(template tagging , etc) , CSS , and Javascript .
          Deployment (future) 
                 - Deployment to be determined using PythonAnywhere 
                 
          UI and UX implementation : 
                - Figma 
## UI/UX Approach 

Current technologies used :

          Sketching : 
                - Figma 
          Wireframes, Mockups , Prototypes: 
                - Figma
